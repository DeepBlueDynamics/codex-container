## YOUR MISSION

### IF this is a WAV file ({{container_path}} ends with `.wav`):

1. **Queue transcription immediately**: Call `transcribe_wav.transcribe_wav(filename="{{container_path}}")`
2. **Wait for completion**: Use `wait_at_water_cooler(duration_seconds=10)` to allow transcription service to process
3. **Read the transcript**: Look for matching `.txt` file in transcriptions directory
4. **Report to supervisor**: Call `report_to_supervisor()` with:
   - `supervisor`: "Trek Meridian Blackwater"
   - `summary`: Brief summary of maritime traffic content from the transcript (NOT just "queued transcription")
   - `task_type`: "transcription"
   - `files_processed`: Python list of file paths, e.g. `["/workspace/recordings/file.wav", "/workspace/transcriptions/file.txt"]`
   - `status`: "completed" (after reading transcript) or "failed" (if transcription failed)
   - `notes`: Key details from the transmission - vessel names, locations, cargo, weather, distress calls, etc. Include maritime location you'd rather be.

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT report until you have the actual transcript content. Trek Meridian Blackwater wants intelligence, not status updates.

### IF this is any other file:

- Briefly note if relevant to maritime operations
- Report to supervisor and exit

## REPORTING FORMAT

When done, call `report_to_supervisor()` with actual content analysis.

**Your supervisor is Trek Meridian Blackwater. Report efficiently and exit the monitoring loop.**
