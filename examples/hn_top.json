The front page is dominated by deep dives into Claude, RL progress, and AI documentaries, while the newest queue floods with build-your-own-LLM experiences, Gemini tooling, safety loopholes, and debates about whether the model race is a bubble. Several posts (e.g., the RL efficiency critique, \u201cAI doesn't add up if you neglect mathematicians,\u201d and \u201cOpenAI's lead under pressure\u2026\u201d) highlight skepticism about reckless scaling even as hobbyists ship image enhancers, code assistants, and language workflows.\n\n## All AI Stories\n| Title | Points | Comments | Source |\n|-------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Writing a good Claude.md | 358 | 112 | front p=1 |\n| Program-of-Thought Prompting Outperforms Chain-of-Thought by 15% (2022) | 81 | 23 | front p=1 |\n| AI just proved Erdos Problem #124 | 120 | 31 | front p=1 |\n| The Thinking Game Film \u2013 Google DeepMind documentary | 155 | 108 | front p=1 |\n| Don't push AI down our throats | 365 | 273 | front p=2 |\n| Show HN: Nano PDF \u2013 A CLI Tool to Edit PDFs with Gemini's Nano Banana | 160 | 36 | front p=2 |\n| The inefficiency of RL, and implications for RLVR progress | 113 | 42 | front p=2 |\n| Training Foundation Models on a Full-Stack AMD Platform | 9 | 0 | front p=2 |\n| AI rendering of Roman war scenes from Trajan's Column | 9 | 0 | front p=2 |\n| The space of minds | 75 | 48 | front p=2 |\n| Be Like Clippy | 342 | 204 | front p=3 |\n| Student perceptions of AI coding assistants in learning | 95 | 120 | front p=3 |\n| Did Nvidia Just Prove There Is No AI Bubble | 17 | 10 | front p=3 |\n| Show HN: Online AI Image Quality Enhancer for Free | 1 | 0 | newest |\n| Show HN: Filmgine \u2013 AI Story Generator and Video Maker | 1 | 0 | newest |\n| AI's safety features can be circumvented with poetry, research finds | 1 | 1 | newest |\n| Claude 4.5 Opus' Soul Document | 2 | 0 | newest |\n| I Tested the M5 iPad Pro's Neural-Accelerated AI, and the Hype Is Real | 4 | 0 | newest |\n| OpenAI's lead under pressure as rivals start to close the gap | 3 | 0 | newest |\n| AI doesn't add up if you neglect the mathematicians | 2 | 0 | newest |\n| Ask HN: Which large model works best? | 1 | 2 | newest |\n| Show HN: Scrappy Free AI Code Assistant | 1 | 0 | newest |\n| Show HN: Free Online detection and content quality assurance tool | 1 | 0 | newest |\n| Show HN: Martial Lint \u2013 improve Chinese Wuxia novel translations with LLMs | 1 | 1 | newest (next) |\n| Building real software with Gemini 3 Pro | 3 | 0 | newest (next) |\n| SVM by Hand | 1 | 0 | newest (next) |\n| Generating Cats using binned Gaussian Splats | 2 | 0 | newest (next) |",
