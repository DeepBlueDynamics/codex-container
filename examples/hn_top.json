Page 3 introduces practical ethics/operational stories such as Flock\u2019s surveillance AI and RL inefficiency musings, showing continuing interest in both deployment and theoretical cost. The newest feed, in contrast, is filled with lightweight Show/Ask HN launches (agent runners, AI-aware productivity tools, context servers) plus corporate moves (OpenAI\u2019s Thrive investment, ads, and Nvidia/OpenAI strategy analysis) that are still accruing engagement; most have 0\u20133 comments, signaling early-stage discussions but a clear focus on agent-context tooling, AI-assisted workflows, and prompt/knowledge engineering.\n\n## All AI Stories\n| Title | Points | Comments | Source |\n|-------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Search tool that only returns content created before ChatGPT's public release | 663 | 261 | front (p=1) |\n| Writing a good Claude.md | 639 | 240 | front (p=1) |\n| AI just proved Erdos Problem #124 | 222 | 77 | front (p=2) |\n| DeepSeekMath-V2: Towards Self-Verifiable Mathematical Reasoning | 215 | 70 | front (p=1) |\n| The Thinking Game Film \u2013 Google DeepMind documentary | 200 | 131 | front (p=2) |\n| X210Ai is a new motherboard to upgrade ThinkPad X201/200 | 142 | 58 | front (p=1) |\n| Program-of-Thought Prompting Outperforms Chain-of-Thought by 15% (2022) | 128 | 33 | front (p=2) |\n| The inefficiency of RL, and implications for RLVR progress | 117 | 45 | front (p=3) |\n| The space of minds | 84 | 52 | front (p=3) |\n| DeepSeek-v3.2 | 55 | 2 | front (p=3) |\n| Show HN: I built a 1.8MB native app with self-built UI, vision and AI libraries | 4 | 1 | newest (page 1) |\n| Show HN: Superset \u2013 Run 10 parallel coding agents on your machine | 3 | 0 | newest (page 1) |\n| AI-Assisted Coding Killed My Joy of Programming | 3 | 1 | newest (page 2) |\n| Google, Nvidia, and OpenAI \u2013 Stratechery by Ben Thompson | 3 | 0 | newest (page 2) |\n| OpenAI Ads Are Coming | 2 | 3 | newest (page 2) |\n| College Students Choosing A.I.
