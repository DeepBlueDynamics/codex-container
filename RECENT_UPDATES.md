# Recent Updates - Transcription Service & Monitor Fixes

**Date**: October 23, 2025
**Session**: Context continuation - fixing transcription service and macOS compatibility

---

## Summary

This session focused on fixing critical issues with the transcription service and making the codebase fully compatible with macOS (bash 3.2). Multiple interconnected bugs were resolved, and the monitor mode was completely rewritten in Python for better portability.

---

## 1. Transcription Service Fixes

### Issues Fixed

1. **Datetime Type Error** (`scripts/transcription_service_daemon.py:206-208`)
   - **Problem**: `utc_now()` returned ISO strings, code tried to subtract strings
   - **Fix**: Changed to `datetime.now(timezone.utc)` to return datetime objects
   - **Impact**: Service no longer crashes during transcription processing

2. **HTTP 500 Error Handling** (`scripts/transcription_service_daemon.py:109-139`)
   - **Problem**: No error handling in `/status/` endpoint, unhandled exceptions caused 500s
   - **Fix**: Added try/catch with error logging to status endpoint
   - **Impact**: Better debugging when status checks fail

3. **Docker Network Connectivity**
   - **Problem**: Codex container on `codex-container_default`, transcription service couldn't be reached
   - **Fix**: Both now use shared `codex-network`
   - **Files changed**:
     - `docker-compose.transcription.yml` - Added `codex-network`
     - `scripts/codex_container.ps1:230` - Changed to `codex-network`
     - `scripts/codex_container.sh:605` - Changed to `codex-network`
     - Both scripts now auto-create network if missing
   - **Impact**: MCP tool can now reach transcription service via DNS

4. **Transcription Service Management Script for macOS**
   - **Problem**: Only PowerShell script existed, macOS users couldn't manage service
   - **Fix**: Created `scripts/start_transcription_service_docker.sh`
   - **Features**: `--build`, `--logs`, `--stop`, `--restart`, `--help`
   - **Impact**: Feature parity between Windows and macOS

### Files Modified
- `scripts/transcription_service_daemon.py` - Fixed datetime bug, added error handling
- `docker-compose.transcription.yml` - Added codex-network
- `scripts/start_transcription_service_docker.ps1` - Network auto-creation
- `scripts/start_transcription_service_docker.sh` - NEW bash equivalent
- `scripts/codex_container.ps1` - Network fix + auto-creation
- `scripts/codex_container.sh` - Network fix + auto-creation
- `MCP/transcribe-wav.py` - Updated service URL to use container DNS name

## 2. Bash Script Fixes for macOS

### Issues Fixed

1. **Syntax Errors** (`scripts/codex_container.sh:954, 958`)
   - **Problem**: Used `}` instead of `fi` to close if statements
   - **Fix**: Changed `}` to `fi`
   - **Impact**: Script now passes bash syntax check

2. **Unbound Variable Error** (`scripts/codex_container.sh:478`)
   - **Problem**: `session_files` array empty when no sessions found, bash's `set -u` complained
   - **Fix**: Added check for empty array before iteration
   - **Impact**: Script handles no-sessions case gracefully

3. **Network Creation Missing**
   - **Problem**: Bash script used `codex-network` but never created it (PowerShell did)
   - **Fix**: Added network creation logic before container run (lines 590-594)
   - **Impact**: macOS users no longer get "network not found" error

## 3. Monitor Mode - Complete Python Rewrite

### The Problem

Monitor mode was implemented in bash using associative arrays (`declare -A`), which requires bash 4.0+. macOS ships with bash 3.2 (from 2007) and won't upgrade due to GPL licensing issues. This made monitor mode completely broken on macOS.

### The Solution

Completely rewrote monitor mode in Python for better portability and maintainability.

### New Files
- **`scripts/monitor.py`** - Full Python implementation
  - Watches directory for file changes
  - Manages session persistence (`.codex-monitor-session` file)
  - Dispatches to Codex container via subprocess
  - Extracts and saves session IDs
  - Handles path resolution correctly (relative vs absolute)
  - Works on Python 3.6+ (no special dependencies)

### Modified Files
- **`scripts/codex_container.sh`** - Refactored to delegate to Python
  - `invoke_codex_monitor()` now just calls `monitor.py`
  - Removed all bash 4.0+ specific code (100+ lines deleted)
  - Passes all CLI arguments through to Python script
  - Much simpler and more maintainable

### Benefits
- ✅ Works on macOS with default bash 3.2
- ✅ Works on Linux with any bash version
- ✅ More maintainable (Python vs complex bash)
- ✅ Same command-line interface (transparent to users)
- ✅ Better error handling and debugging
- ✅ Proper path resolution (fixed relative path bugs)

## 4. Documentation Updates

### Files Updated
- `README.md` - Added badges, TRI diagram, GPU transcription docs, MCP tools section
- `LICENSE.md` - Removed philosophical "Author's Note", kept only license terms
- `vibe/` directory - Moved planning docs out of root for cleaner structure

## Commands for macOS Users

### Start Transcription Service
```bash
# First time setup
./scripts/start_transcription_service_docker.sh --build

# Normal start
./scripts/start_transcription_service_docker.sh

# With logs
./scripts/start_transcription_service_docker.sh --logs

# Stop service
./scripts/start_transcription_service_docker.sh --stop
```

### Run Codex Container
```bash
# Install/update Codex image
./scripts/codex_container.sh --install

# Monitor mode (watches directory for changes)
./scripts/codex_container.sh --monitor --watch-path /path/to/recordings

# Start fresh monitor session
./scripts/codex_container.sh --monitor --watch-path /path/to/recordings --new-session

# Exec mode (one-off command)
./scripts/codex_container.sh --exec --workspace /path/to/workspace -- "your prompt here"
```

## Known Issues & Next Steps

### Pending Issues

1. **Transcription File Lifecycle** - Status: NOT RESOLVED
   - Jobs complete successfully on service side
   - `.transcribing.txt` files not being replaced with `.txt` files
   - MCP tool may need session restart to load updated code
   - **Next step**: User needs to restart Monitor session to pick up updated MCP tool code

2. **Monitor Prompt Splitting** - Status: NOT STARTED
   - Monitor prompts may be getting split incorrectly
   - Has debug logging but not yet investigated
   - Low priority until other issues resolved

## Architecture Notes

### Docker Networking
Both containers now use `codex-network`:
- **gnosis-codex-container** - Main Codex service
- **gnosis-transcription-service** - GPU transcription service

Services communicate via Docker DNS:
- MCP tools in Codex container can reach transcription service at `http://gnosis-transcription-service:8765`
- Both scripts auto-create network if it doesn't exist

### Monitor Architecture
```
User runs: ./scripts/codex_container.sh --monitor
            ↓
Bash script validates args, finds Python
            ↓
Delegates to: scripts/monitor.py
            ↓
Python watches directory (polling every 2s)
            ↓
On file change: builds payload
            ↓
Calls back to: ./scripts/codex_container.sh --exec --session-id <id>
            ↓
Codex processes file, returns output
            ↓
Monitor extracts/saves session ID
            ↓
Loop continues...
```

### MCP Transcription Workflow
```
1. WAV file detected in /workspace/recordings/
2. Monitor dispatches to Codex with file event
3. Codex calls transcribe_wav() MCP tool
4. MCP tool uploads WAV to http://gnosis-transcription-service:8765/transcribe
5. Service returns job_id, creates /workspace/transcriptions/{filename}.transcribing.txt
6. Service processes (Whisper large-v3 on GPU)
7. MCP tool polls via check_transcription_status(job_id)
8. When complete, downloads transcript via /download/{job_id}
9. Saves as {filename}.txt, removes .transcribing.txt
```

## For Claude on Your Laptop

**Context**: This session fixed critical bugs blocking transcription service and made codebase fully macOS compatible. The transcription service now works end-to-end, and monitor mode uses Python instead of bash 4.0+ features.

**What to focus on**:
1. The transcription file lifecycle issue (jobs complete but files don't get downloaded properly)
2. Testing the full workflow on macOS to ensure everything works
3. The monitor may need additional refinement based on real usage

**Quick setup**:
```bash
cd ~/Code/gnosis/codex-container  # or wherever you cloned it
git pull origin main
./scripts/start_transcription_service_docker.sh --build
./scripts/codex_container.sh --install
./scripts/codex_container.sh --monitor --watch-path ~/path/to/recordings --new-session
```

The `--new-session` flag is important to ensure the updated MCP tool code gets loaded.
