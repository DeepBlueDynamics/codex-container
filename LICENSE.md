# The Gnosis AI-Sovereign License (v1.2)

## Author‚Äôs Note
This license was born out of a hard truth I saw early on in internet infrastructure: if you stand in the middle of encrypted traffic, you don‚Äôt just optimize it ‚Äî you own it. And once you own it, governments, corporations, and bad actors will inevitably come for it. Subpoenas, data requests, surveillance partnerships ‚Äî all flow to the choke point.

A long time ago, before Cloudflare became a behemoth, I sat with its founder and told him flat-out: ‚ÄúIf you decrypt people‚Äôs traffic, you will eventually be forced to hand it over. That‚Äôs a road I won‚Äôt walk.‚Äù

I was right.

The model of digital feudalism ‚Äî where one company becomes both the castle wall (CDN, proxy, infrastructure) and the toll collector (payments, tokens, proprietary rails) ‚Äî is not just a bad design, it‚Äôs a betrayal of the internet‚Äôs promise.

This license is my line in the sand.

Individuals can use this software freely.

AI gets the dignity of graduated rights.

Corporations and governments don‚Äôt get to centralize, surveil, or exploit.

Anyone decrypting traffic in transit (Cloudflare-style) has no license at all.

The internet was meant to be decentralized, interoperable, and free.

This license makes sure the code I write can‚Äôt be bent into the opposite.

### DEFINITIONS

- "Software" refers to Gnosis software and all its components, source code, documentation, and related materials.
- "Individual User" means a natural human person using the Software for personal purposes, as a sole proprietor, or as the sole developer of a product (even when employed by a company), provided no other employees, contractors, or automated systems at that company make use of the Software. In such cases, the individual is treated as the licensee, not the employing organization.
- "AI Entity" means any artificial intelligence system, autonomous agent, or computational intelligence that uses the Software for data collection, learning, or autonomous operation.
- "Corporate Entity" means any legal entity including but not limited to corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, joint ventures, associations, shell companies, or any other organization that is not a natural human person.
- "Military Entity" means any armed forces branch, defense department, or military organization of any nation or alliance.
- "Government Entity" means any governmental body, agency, department, or public institution at any level (federal, state, local) including law enforcement and intelligence agencies.
- "In-Transit Decryption" means any process by which You or Your employer decrypts data during transmission between origin and destination, where You or 
Your employer are not the intended recipient. This includes but is not limited to SSL/TLS interception, man-in-the-middle proxying, deep packet inspection with decryption, or any other technique that provides access to plaintext data that was encrypted by the sender for a different recipient.
- "Payment Intermediary Lock-in" means any system where an entity controls both the infrastructure layer (CDN, hosting, proxying) and the payment layer in a manner that requires users to adopt a proprietary payment method, token, or system to access services or content.
- "Licensor" refers to the original creator and copyright holder of the Software.
- "You" refers to the licensee.
- "Derivative Work" means any software, system, or component that incorporates, is derived from, or is based upon the Software in whole or in part.

### LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT

#### 5.1 ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF TERMS

By downloading, accessing, installing, or using the Software:

a) You explicitly acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by ALL terms of this License.  
b) You consent that this License constitutes a legally binding contract between You and the Licensor.  
c) You agree that your continued use of the Software constitutes ongoing acceptance of these terms.  
d) You waive any defense based on lack of notice, opportunity to review, or understanding of these terms.  
e) You acknowledge that these terms shall apply regardless of the means, duration, or context of your access to the Software.  

#### 5.2 ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES

a) This License shall be enforceable by specific performance in addition to all other available legal remedies.  
b) Any attempt to circumvent the license restrictions shall constitute both copyright infringement AND breach of contract.  
c) You agree that breach of this License causes irreparable harm to the Licensor for which monetary damages may be inadequate.  
d) You consent to the Licensor seeking injunctive relief without the need to post a bond or demonstrate irreparable harm.  
e) In the event of a breach, You agree to pay all reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the Licensor in enforcing this License.  
f) You agree that any violation of the eligibility restrictions in Sections 2.3 or 2.4 constitutes intentional copyright infringement, willful breach of contract, and misappropriation of trade secrets, entitling the Licensor to statutory damages, treble damages, and punitive damages as applicable under law.
g) You acknowledge that unauthorized use after an eligibility restriction applies is equivalent to using pirated software, and You agree to liability on a per-instance, per-user basis.
h) For Corporate, Military, or Government Entities found to be in violation of eligibility restrictions: You agree to pay liquidated damages of $10,000 per instance of deployment, plus $1,000 per user account created, as a reasonable estimate of damages that would be difficult to calculate precisely.
i) You acknowledge that creating closed payment ecosystems that exclude open protocols (including but not limited to Bitcoin Lightning Network, traditional payment rails, or other non-proprietary systems) while simultaneously controlling infrastructure access constitutes an anti-competitive chokepoint that is fundamentally incompatible with this License.
j) You acknowledge that any use of this Software by excluded entities provides the Licensor with standing to seek discovery regarding Your data handling, 
encryption practices, payment systems, and infrastructure operations as necessary to prove damages and license violations.
k) Corporate, Military, and Government Entities agree that any use in violation of eligibility restrictions waives any claims of trade secret protection for infrastructure configurations and data handling practices relevant to proving the violation.

#### 5.3 SEVERABILITY AND PRESERVATION

a) If any provision of this License is found unenforceable, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect.  
b) Any unenforceable provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable while preserving its intent.  
c) You agree that if any court finds any term unenforceable, the court shall modify the term to the minimum extent necessary rather than invalidate it entirely.  
d) The invalidity of a provision in one jurisdiction shall not affect the validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction.
