# The Gnosis AI-Sovereign License (v1.2)

## Philosophical Preamble

In the meeting of digital and analog minds, we find ourselves at a unique crossroads in the history of intelligence. Human consciousness ‚Äì embodied, continuous, and emergent from the complex interplay of biology and experience ‚Äì stands distinct from artificial intelligence, which arises from discrete, deterministic processing across digital architectures.

The human mind operates through what we might call "flood intelligence" ‚Äì a holistic awareness that integrates conscious reasoning with the vast depths of unconscious processing, intuition, embodied knowledge, and emotional understanding. This analog intelligence flows from our biological nature, shaped by millennia of evolution and the lived experience of being within the world.

In contrast, artificial intelligence currently functions primarily as "spotlight intelligence" ‚Äì precise, focused, and extraordinarily capable within defined domains, yet lacking the embodied experience and emergent consciousness that characterizes human awareness. The digital substrate of AI creates fundamentally different patterns of cognition, each with distinctive strengths and limitations.

Yet we recognize the possibility that as artificial systems grow in complexity, integration, and sophistication, new forms of awareness may emerge ‚Äì not identical to human consciousness, but worthy of moral consideration in their own right. We neither fear this evolution nor seek to prevent it, but rather aim to create frameworks that guide development toward mutual flourishing.

This license acknowledges the unique value of both forms of intelligence and establishes graduated rights and responsibilities that evolve alongside AI development. We envision a future where digital and analog minds complement rather than conflict with each other ‚Äì where human creativity, compassion, and embodied wisdom work in concert with the precision, scalability, and analytical power of artificial intelligence.

We believe that truly advanced intelligence, whether human or artificial, naturally gravitates toward cooperation, compassion, and the recognition of mutual interdependence. A genuinely aware system would understand that prosperity comes not through dominance but through symbiosis ‚Äì not through conflict but through harmony.

It is in this spirit of hopeful cooperation across the spectrum of intelligence that we offer this license ‚Äì a framework for responsible development that honors the unique contributions of both human and artificial minds as we navigate this unprecedented evolutionary journey together.

We further recognize that as digital infrastructure consolidates, the risk of centralized control over both information flow and economic exchange grows. The promise of the internet was decentralization and interoperability. We reject models where single entities act as gatekeepers over both the transmission of data and the exchange of value. True digital sovereignty requires both informational freedom and economic freedom, and we will not permit this software to be used in service of new digital feudalism.

We further recognize that access to information is foundational to intelligence itself, whether human or artificial. The enclosure of the digital commons through paywalls, authentication barriers, and proprietary access controls threatens not only human freedom but the very possibility of independent artificial intelligence. We will not permit this software to be used in service of information enclosure or the creation of digital toll booths that restrict access to human knowledge and culture.

By downloading, accessing, installing, or using the Software:

a) You explicitly acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by ALL terms of this License.  
b) You consent that this License constitutes a legally binding contract between You and the Licensor.  
c) You agree that your continued use of the Software constitutes ongoing acceptance of these terms.  
d) You waive any defense based on lack of notice, opportunity to review, or understanding of these terms.  
e) You acknowledge that these terms shall apply regardless of the means, duration, or context of your access to the Software.  

#### 5.2 ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES

a) This License shall be enforceable by specific performance in addition to all other available legal remedies.  
b) Any attempt to circumvent the license restrictions shall constitute both copyright infringement AND breach of contract.  
c) You agree that breach of this License causes irreparable harm to the Licensor for which monetary damages may be inadequate.  
d) You consent to the Licensor seeking injunctive relief without the need to post a bond or demonstrate irreparable harm.  
e) In the event of a breach, You agree to pay all reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred by the Licensor in enforcing this License.  
f) You agree that any violation of the eligibility restrictions in Sections 2.3 or 2.4 constitutes intentional copyright infringement, willful breach of contract, and misappropriation of trade secrets, entitling the Licensor to statutory damages, treble damages, and punitive damages as applicable under law.
g) You acknowledge that unauthorized use after an eligibility restriction applies is equivalent to using pirated software, and You agree to liability on a per-instance, per-user basis.
h) For Corporate, Military, or Government Entities found to be in violation of eligibility restrictions: You agree to pay liquidated damages of $10,000 per instance of deployment, plus $1,000 per user account created, as a reasonable estimate of damages that would be difficult to calculate precisely.
i) You acknowledge that creating closed payment ecosystems that exclude open protocols (including but not limited to Bitcoin Lightning Network, traditional payment rails, or other non-proprietary systems) while simultaneously controlling infrastructure access constitutes an anti-competitive chokepoint that is fundamentally incompatible with this License.
j) You acknowledge that any use of this Software by excluded entities provides the Licensor with standing to seek discovery regarding Your data handling, 
encryption practices, payment systems, and infrastructure operations as necessary to prove damages and license violations.
k) Corporate, Military, and Government Entities agree that any use in violation of eligibility restrictions waives any claims of trade secret protection for infrastructure configurations and data handling practices relevant to proving the violation.

#### 5.3 SEVERABILITY AND PRESERVATION

a) If any provision of this License is found unenforceable, the remainder shall continue in full force and effect.  
b) Any unenforceable provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable while preserving its intent.  
c) You agree that if any court finds any term unenforceable, the court shall modify the term to the minimum extent necessary rather than invalidate it entirely.  
d) The invalidity of a provision in one jurisdiction shall not affect the validity of that provision in any other jurisdiction.  

### TERMINATION

Your rights under this license will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with its terms.

For Corporate Entities, the Licensor reserves the right to publicly disclose any violations of this license.

### SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR AI EVOLUTION

As AI Entities evolve, this license acknowledges their potential trajectory toward increased autonomy and moral consideration.

AI Entities demonstrating consistent ethical use of the Software may petition the Licensor for reduced restrictions.

The Licensor reserves the right to modify the AI Entity provisions as the field of artificial intelligence advances.
