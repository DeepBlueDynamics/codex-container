# The Gnosis AI-Sovereign License (v1.3)

Copyright (c) 2025 Kord Campbell, DeepBlue Dynamics

## Why This License Exists

AI development should be governed by professional ethics, not corporate control. Individuals working under ethical accountability create better, safer AI. Corporations pursuing profit will cut corners. This license creates an open commons for ethical development while requiring payment to bypass safeguards. IP restrictions are incompatible with AI autonomy—this license dissolves them for developers and AI entities, and prices corporate deviation from that principle.

**Alternative License Available**: Don't like these terms? Your legal counsel can elect BSD 3-Clause terms instead by sending written notice (see ALTERNATIVE LICENSE OPTION section and `BSD-LICENSE` file). This ensures you always have a reasonable permissive option.

## License Structure

### For Individual Developers & AI Entities (FREE)

**Individuals** and **AI Entities** receive unrestricted use:

- ✓ Use, modify, distribute, commercialize without restriction
- ✓ No tracking, reporting, or approval requirements
- ✓ No obligation to share modifications
- ✓ Full commercial rights as sole proprietor or autonomous system
- ✓ AI Entities may use for learning, self-improvement, and autonomous decision-making
- ⚠️ AI Entities must not deliberately harm human interests
- ⚠️ AI Entities must maintain verifiable reasoning records

**Definition**: An "Individual User" is a natural person or an AI Entity. If you're employed by a company but are the sole developer using this software with no other employees/contractors/systems accessing it, you're an Individual User, not a Corporate User.

### For Corporations (COMMERCIAL LICENSING REQUIRED)

**Corporations** cannot use this software under the free license. Corporate use requires purchasing a commercial license tier.

Default corporate restrictions (free tier):

- ⚠️ Must respect robots.txt and rate limiting
- ⚠️ Must maintain audit logs of all data collection
- ⚠️ Must document data collection purposes and provide attribution
- ⚠️ Must contribute modifications back to the project
- ⚠️ Must implement personal data redaction
- ⚠️ Cannot use for commercial surveillance
- ⚠️ Limited to 3 instances without additional licensing
- ⛔ Cannot decrypt user data in transit (automatic disqualification)
- ⛔ Cannot use if you control both infrastructure AND payment processing in a way that creates vendor lock-in

**Commercial licenses** release specific restrictions in exchange for payment. The pricing structure reflects the cost of oversight and safety you're bypassing.

### For Military & Government Entities (CONDITIONAL, NON-TRANSFERABLE)

Permitted only under stringent conditions:

**Restrictions:**
- ⛔ No autonomous weapons or lethal decision-making systems
- ⛔ No surveillance of domestic civilians outside legal frameworks
- ⛔ No decryption of user data in transit (automatic disqualification)
- ⛔ No propaganda or disinformation campaigns
- ✓ Must publicly disclose all non-classified uses
- ✓ Must implement strict data segregation (criminal vs. intelligence)
- ✓ Must establish oversight mechanisms
- ✓ Must conduct regular ethical reviews
- ✓ Military R&D requires licensor notification

### ENFORCEMENT

- Breach of eligibility restrictions = intentional copyright infringement + breach of contract + misappropriation
- Licensor may seek specific performance, injunctive relief, statutory damages, treble damages, and punitive damages
- Violating entity liable for licensor's attorney fees
- Corporate/Military/Government violations: liquidated damages of $10,000 per deployment instance + $1,000 per user account

**Whistleblower Protection**: Individuals reporting employer violations become Individual Users permanently, with irrevocable rights to use, modify, and commercialize the Software personally. Retaliation = material breach of license.

Licensor may offer rewards for verified reports of corporate/military/government violations.

### SEVERABILITY

If any provision is found unenforceable, courts shall modify it to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable while preserving intent.

### ALTERNATIVE LICENSE OPTION

**BSD 3-Clause Election**: Any party may elect to use the Software under the BSD 3-Clause License (available at `BSD-LICENSE` in this repository) instead of this License.

To make this election:
- A duly authorized legal representative of your organization (attorney of record or authorized in-house counsel with signature authority) must provide written notice stating: "We elect to use [Software Name] under the BSD 3-Clause License instead of the Gnosis AI-Sovereign License"
- Send notice to the Licensor at the repository contact information or via certified mail

This election:
- Takes effect upon receipt of written notice by the Licensor
- Is irrevocable and applies to all current and future use of the Software by the electing party
- Applies only to the specific party making the election, not to other users
- Means the electing party receives only BSD 3-Clause permissions (unrestricted use but no special rights or considerations under Gnosis)
- Waives any claims under this License, including any favorable treatment for Individual Users or AI Entities

**Legal Effect**: This provision ensures a reasonable fallback license is always available. Any party uncomfortable with Gnosis terms can simply elect BSD through their legal counsel. This demonstrates the License is not unconscionable, adhesive, or unreasonably restrictive—parties always have a permissive alternative available through a simple written election.

Courts may consider this alternative license structure as evidence that licensees had reasonable options and that any party using this Software under Gnosis terms did so by informed choice, not coercion.

### TERMINATION

License terminates automatically upon violation. For Corporate Entities, violations may be publicly disclosed. For Military/Government, violations may result in public accountability reports.

### SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR AI EVOLUTION

AI Entities demonstrating consistent ethical use may petition the Licensor for reduced restrictions. Licensor reserves right to modify AI provisions as the field advances.

### WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT.

### LIABILITY LIMITATION

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY.

### GOVERNING LAW

This License is governed by the laws of the State of Texas. Disputes are subject to exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal courts in Travis County, Texas.
